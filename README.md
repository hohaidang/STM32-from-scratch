# STM32-from-scratch build driver for SPI, I2C, UART, etc.

## Overview

This project is aim for learning. Built all of the things from sratch for fully understanding the communication protocol and hardware configuration.

Almost projects are devloped in C++11.

## Environment
* Windows 10 or MacOS.

* Nucleo STM32F446RE board with ARM Cortex M4.

* Bosch BME280 sensor - reading temperature, humidity, pressure via SPI communication protocol.

* Saleae Black 4 Logic Analyzier - Debugging.

## Projects

### 1. Reading sensor BME280 via SPI (Check out 004_SPI_driver_CPP for more details)
